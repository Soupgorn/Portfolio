          </div>
          <div class="studentcouncil-text">I had the chance to be part of the student council, where 
          I learned how to handle different opinions and promote unity
          within the group. I also organized activities that
          strengthened friendships among students and created a
          positive school environment. This experience made me
          proud and motivated me to keep improving myself. I hope to
          use what I learned in my daily life and future.</div>

          <div class="volunteer-text">During my time in the student council, I took part
            in various volunteer activities. This experience
            helped me learn new skills that I can apply to 
            my personal growth. For instance, I assisted with
            the BRR Fun Run at school and underwent
            training as a member of the student council.</div>

          <div class="iep-text">Participating in group projects and community service has
            taught me how to think critically and come up with
            innovative solutions to challenges. Iâ€™ve also learned the
            value of teamwork and collaboration, which are essential for
            both personal and academic growth. Overall, this program
            has been instrumental in my journey to improve myself while
            making a positive impact on those around me.</div>
